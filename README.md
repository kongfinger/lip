International newspaper article headline scraper

This code relies on Python 2.7 and BeautifulSoup package.  All files should be placed in the interpreter library folder or the PYTHONPATH environment variable on DOS or UNIX.  The scraper is not case-sensitive and uses terms meaning the first letter of each searchterm should be capitalized and separated by comma.  I havenâ€™t tested it on Python 3 or later.
