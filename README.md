International newspaper article headline scraper

This code relies on Python 2.7 and BeautifulSoup package.  All files should be placed in the interpreter library folder or the PYTHONPATH environment variable on DOS or UNIX.  The scraper is not case-sensitive and uses terms meaning the first letter of each searchterm should be capitalized and separated by comma.  I havenâ€™t tested it on Python 3 or later.  the foreign IP addresses are not completely secure.  I highly recommend running this software from cron daily on a private cloud host on google or AWS to avoid getting a losing IP hack by running this software capable on a home computer.  My main deployment gap is managing the bandwidth budget with periodic cron use.  I have also successfully used this software to PEG (Price Estimator Grain) for document frequency of commodities like gold tracked eeekly along with volume and priva fluctuations to discern a correlation with document frequency.  Interestingly, my initial ping sweeps have demonstrated speculation on gold in bulk with a variety of automatic trading software from private vendors producing the same buy or sell decisions.
